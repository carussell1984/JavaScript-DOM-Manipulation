# Javascript & DOM Manipulation
<h2>Background</h2>

  <code>ALIENS-R-REAL</code> has collected all of the eye-witness reports on extra-terrestrial menace! Now the objective is to put this information online for the world to see.
  
  There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.
We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values with the following tools: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js. 

<h2>Your Task</h2>

<h3>Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search</h3>

 * Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

 * Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

      -Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

<h3>Level 2: Multiple Search Categories</h3>

  * Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

    - date/time
    - city
    - state
    - country
    - shape
